                    <h3>What is this website for ?</h3>
                    <p>This web site serves two purposes:</p>
                    <p>
                        It collects HTTP <code>Alt-Svc</code> headers sent by web-servers of popular domain names in the
                        hope of discovering IETF-QUIC capable hosts. It lists the versions advertised by the hosts,
                        if any.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        It also runs a test suite that exchanges packets with IETF-QUIC implementations to verify
                        whether an implementation conforms with the IETF specification of QUIC. The test suite is
                        consisting of several test scenarii. Each of them aims at testing a particular feature of the
                        QUIC protocol. The test suite runs daily, and its results are available on this website.
                    </p>

                        This work is part of my master thesis for my master's degree in Computer Science at
                        <a href="https://uclouvain.be" target="_blank">Universit√© catholique de Louvain</a>. It is
                        supervised by Pr. Olivier Bonaventure and Quentin De Coninck.
