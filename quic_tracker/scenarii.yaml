ack_only:
  name: ACK only
  description: |
    This test performs a handshake, then opens stream 0 to perform an HTTP/0.9 GET request. It will ack every packet with a packet containing a single ACK frame. The test fails and the connection is closed as soon as the host sends an ACK-only packet in response of an ACK-only packet.
  error_codes:
    1: The handshake did not complete
    2: Host sent an ACK-only packet in response of an ACK-only packet

address_validation:
  name: Address validation
  description: |
    This test verifies that the server is validating the client address using the Client Address Validation Procedure and does not send more than three times the amount of data sent by the test. The test sends an Initial packet and then intentionally does not reply to any packet received. After 3 seconds of inactivity during which no violation has been observed, the test issues ACKs to the received packets and completes the handshake.
  error_codes:
    1: The handshake did not complete
    2: The host sent more than three UDP datagrams without address validation
    3: The host sent more than three times the initial amount of data sent

connection_migration:
  name: Connection Migration
  description: |
    This test performs and handshake and then replace its UDP connection with a new one 3 seconds after the connection is established. It will change the source port used to communicate with the host. Then it will open stream 0 to perform an HTTP/0.9 GET request and check if the host respond through this new connection. The host is also checked to validate the new path using <code>PATH_CHALLENGE</code>.
  error_codes:
    1: The TLS handshake failed

flow_control:
  name: Flow control
  description: |
    This test checks the proper behavior of the flow-control mechanisms, namely <code>MAX_STREAM_DATA</code> frames and the <code>initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local</code> transport parameters.
    A handshake will be performed and <code>initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local</code> will be set to 80 bytes. Then stream 0 is opened and a HTTP/0.9 GET request is performed.
    The test checks if the host complies with the given limits and sends a 80-byte chunk of data, and will proceed to set an higher limit of 160 bytes with a <code>MAX_STREAM_DATA</code> frame. The tests will check if data is sent after increasing the limit, and if the host complies with it. The connection is closed after 10s.
  error_codes:
    1: The handshake did not complete
    2: The host sent more data than the offset advertised
    3: The host did not resume sending after increasing the limit
    4: No enough data was available to perform the test
